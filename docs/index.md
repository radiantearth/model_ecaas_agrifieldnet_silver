# Weighted Tree-based Crop Classification Models for Imbalanced Datasets

Second place solution to classify crop types in agricultural fields across Northern India using multispectral observations from Sentinel-2 satellite. Ensembled weighted tree-based models "LGBM, CATBOOST, XGBOOST" with stratified k-fold cross validation, taking advantage of spatial variability around each field within different distances.

## Model Inferencing

Review the [GitHub repository README](../README.md) to get started running
this model for new inferencing.

### Training

Prepare the data for tree models by computing the average values of the pixels within each field, then feature engineering by computing spatial variability, more vegetation, and flowering phenology indices.

Zonal statistics  (mean , min, max, std) within different radiuses (0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.50, 3.50, 5.00) Km around each field

### Model

Weighted average tree-based models: lightgbm. catboost, xgboost classifers.

### Structure of Output Data

- Predictions.csv: Final predictions text file, with 13 crops classes as following
 `Wheat, Mustard, Lentil, No Crop, Sugarcane, Garlic, Potato, Green pea, Bersem, Coriander, Gram, Maize, Rice`

- veg_indices.csv: Extracted vegetation indices for each field.

- Field_stats_indices.csv: Extracted statistics for each field.
